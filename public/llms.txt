Hup: Decentralized Social Layer

Hup is a high-performance, decentralized social protocol designed for permanent, user-owned social graphs and creator-centric economic value. It leverages blockchain for immutability and IPFS for scalable content storage.

Core Project Mission

User Ownership: Social graphs are verifiable on-chain and portable across applications.

Economic Value: Native tipping and capital allocation features are built directly into the social layer.

Sustainability: Low-fee architecture using IPFS CID pinning on-chain rather than raw data storage.

Technical Architecture (Milestone 1 - Complete)

1. Identity & Social Graph

On-Chain Identity: Profiles are linked to wallet addresses with metadata fetched via a Profile Bridge (Gravatar-style).

Verifiable Graph: Following and unfollowing actions are recorded on the blockchain, creating a portable, non-custodial social graph.

2. Content Layer (IPFS + CID)

Editor: A custom markdown/media editor that handles the IPFS upload lifecycle.

Immutable Links: Only the IPFS Content Identifier (CID) is stored on-chain.

Scalable Feeds: Client-side logic utilizes paginated Web3.js getPastEvents calls (chunked by 5000 blocks) to rebuild social feeds from logs.

3. Economic Layer

Creator Tipping: Fully functional on-chain tipping logic allowing users to send value directly to post authors.

Capital Allocation: Designed for seamless value flow between supporters and creators without centralized intermediaries.

Key Technical Specifications for LLMs

Chain: Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 (e.g., Base/Testnet).

Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

Communication: Web3.js / Wagmi for blockchain interaction.

Data Retrieval: Event-based indexing.
